I am an advocate for the responsible use of data and believe in maintaining transparency while ensuring privacy in analytics. My active GitHub profile contains various business analytics reports that I share publicly.

I enjoy working on business analytics assignments in this course, which align with my passion. I am keen to exploring more about how analytics works in the real world.
