    "text": "What do recent data say about consumer spending On Valentince’s Day?\nAs Valentine’s Day approaches, many of us start thinking about how to show our love and appreciation for our partners, friends, and family. However, Valentine’s Day is more than just a day of love; it’s also a major event for retailers that drives billions of dollars in consumer spending on gifts and celebrations each year. While traditional gifts like flowers, candy, and greeting cards remain popular, but younger generations are redefining how Valentine’s Day is celebrated by exploring alternatives beyond these traditional gifts. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said that “with consumers prioritizing their spouse or significant other this year, retailers expect to see a shift in spending for certain gifting categories.” As consumer preferences shift, is Valentine’s Day retail need of a modern makeover to meet the demand? Hence, we will examine the evolving landscape of Valentine’s Day spending through insights from National Retail Federation (NRF) surveys, providing essential trends for retailers and marketers to adapt their strategies and offerings.\n\n\nData from?\nData description Analysis Conclusio"
